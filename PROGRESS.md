# Chronicle Worlds — Progress Log

This document is the **single source of truth** for development progress. Each milestone includes what was done, key decisions, and exactly what to do next — with direct references to prior work so development can resume from this file alone.

---

## Project Overview

**Chronicle Worlds** is a turn-based, multiplayer, procedural world simulation hosted entirely on Supabase, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. Players control characters on a shared 3D grid, issuing one of five actions per turn simultaneously, with time as the core resource.

**Stack:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Auth + Realtime) · GitHub (migrations, versioning, CI/CD) · GitHub Pages (Vite + JS frontend)

**Supabase Project:** andredavisme's Project (`hhyhulqngdkwsxhymmcd`, region: `us-west-2`)

**Inspired by:** [andredavisme/the-world](https://github.com/andredavisme/the-world)

## Architecture — Truth / Reality Model

Established 2026-05-10. This is the canonical design contract for the simulation layer.

### Truth Schema (canonical layer)
The existing DB tables (`characters`, `settings`, `materials`, `physical_environments`, `events`) are the **truth schema**. Entities exist here as the authoritative record — their attributes define what makes each entity ontologically distinct. No names, no descriptions, no narrative. Adding a new entity to truth automatically makes it available to all realities.

### Realities (interpretive world instances)
A **reality** is a named world instance that interprets the truth schema. When a reality encounters a truth entity, it spawns an **entity copy** seeded with the truth attribute values. The copy then gains reality-exclusive attributes: `name`, `description`, and a `local_attributes` JSONB delta that diverges independently from truth.

- Realities are the **world-instance axis** — parallel to, not a superset of, branches
- Branches remain the **time axis** (chronicle forks within a reality)
- The same truth entity can exist as multiple copies across multiple realities, each with a unique identity derived from `copy_id` + `proc_words` + reality context

```
Truth Schema
  └─ Reality A  (branch_id=0 → branch_id=1 → branch_id=2)
  └─ Reality B  (branch_id=0 → ...)
  └─ Reality C  (branch_id=0 → ...)
```

### Naming Convention
Names are **never stored in truth**. They are computed in the reality layer from:
1. `proc_words` vocabulary (already exists)
2. The copy's `copy_id` as a deterministic seed
3. The reality's own context (`inspiration`, future `setting_type`)

Same truth entity → different `copy_id` seed → different name per reality. Stable within a reality; unique across realities.

## Milestone Log

---

### ✅ Milestones 1–8b — (see prior entries)
All prior milestones complete. Schema, Edge Function, frontend scaffold, Realtime, testing, infra fixes, mobile responsiveness, migration repo sync. See commit history for details.

---

### ✅ Milestone 9 — Natural Progression Loop
**Date:** 2026-05-10 | **Status:** Complete

- `pg_cron` job `world-tick` — `* * * * *` — ACTIVE
- Frontend: `world-tick` Realtime channel on `world_tick_state`

---

### ✅ Milestone 10 — World Seeding + Grid Bootstrap
**Date:** 2026-05-10 | **Status:** Complete
**Migration:** `010_world_seeding` | **Commit:** `5190083`

See prior entry for full details. Summary:
- 7×7×1 `grid_cells` seeded for genesis setting
- entity_positions: char1@(0,0,0), char7@(1,1,0), material101@(-1,0,0), setting1@(0,0,0)
- `seed_setting_grid()` helper; `world_tick()` patched; `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` on entity_positions
- Frontend: isometric boundary box per setting, `#world-time` footer (tu/du), entity_positions Realtime channel

---

### ✅ CI/CD Fix — GitHub Pages Deploy Pipeline
**Date:** 2026-05-10 | **Status:** Complete
**Commits:** `de6b193` (workflow fix) → `69a09d4` (permissions) → `fb997a3` (trigger) — **Deploy #29 ✅ green**

**Fix sequence:**
1. Changed `publish_branch: main` → `publish_branch: gh-pages` in `deploy.yml`
2. Created `gh-pages` branch
3. Added `permissions: pages: write / id-token: write`
4. Updated Pages source in repo Settings → Pages → branch: `gh-pages`, folder: `/ (root)` *(manual)*
5. Pushed a `frontend/` touch commit to trigger a fresh run

**Result:** Site live at [andredavisme.github.io/chronicle-worlds](https://andredavisme.github.io/chronicle-worlds/)

**Key lesson:** Never re-run a failed workflow to test a `deploy.yml` fix — always push a new commit to `frontend/**`.

**Key lesson:** `docs/index.html` is the Vite **build output** — overwritten on every deploy. All frontend source changes must go into `frontend/src/` and `frontend/index.html`.

---

### ✅ Milestone 11 — Travel Action + Grid Movement
**Date:** 2026-05-10 | **Status:** Complete
**Commits:** `fb75a46` (Vite source), `7f04134` (docs guard, superseded), `a7f889b` (initial, superseded)

- `frontend/index.html`: direction picker modal (N/S/E/W/Up/Down, 3×3 compass grid)
- `app.js`: `getAdjacentCellId(direction, characterId)` — reads actor's entity_positions, applies DIR_DELTA, looks up target grid_cells row
- Travel button opens modal; on direction chosen calls `submitAction('travel', { destination_grid_cell_id })`
- `gameInitialised` flag guards channel subscriptions against double-fire
- Validated live: char1 moved N from `(0,0,0)` → `(0,-1,0)`

**Bugfixes:**
- Migration `011_public_read_world_state`: SELECT policies on world_tick_state + settings
- Migration `012_public_read_game_tables`: SELECT policies on entity_positions + grid_cells + players

**Key decisions:**
- Up/Down boundary: correct — z≠0 cells only exist when structures/terrain warrant them
- Cross-setting travel deferred
- `destination_grid_cell_id` is the canonical travel payload

---

### ✅ Milestone 12 — World Discovery System
**Date:** 2026-05-10 | **Status:** Complete
**Migration:** `add_setting_discovery_fields` | **Edge Function:** `discover-cell` (v2, ACTIVE) | **Commit:** `ce3a49f`

- Added `max_cells` and `cycle_order` to `settings` table
- `discover-cell` Edge Function — called on every movement attempt
- `getAdjacentCellId()` rewritten to invoke `discover-cell` with `{ x, y, z, from_cell_id }`
- Undiscovered cells spawn on demand; status bar shows `"discovering new cell to the [dir]…"`

**Discovery logic:**
| Scenario | Cell assigned to |
|---|---|
| Cell already exists | Returned immediately |
| Travel, previous setting has room | Same setting as origin |
| Travel, previous setting full | Next setting in `cycle_order` |
| No next setting exists | New setting spawned dynamically |
| Entity spawn, no travel context | Random existing setting |

**Key decisions:**
- `from_cell_id` is the travel context signal
- Settings spawned with `time_unit: 0` as placeholder — identity deferred to reality layer (Milestone 13)

---

### ✅ Milestone 13a — Truth / Reality Schema Foundation
**Date:** 2026-05-10 | **Status:** Complete
**Migration:** `014_realities_and_entity_copies`

**What was done:**
- Established the **Truth / Reality architecture** as the canonical simulation contract (see Architecture section above)
- Created `realities` table — world instances parallel to (not subsuming) branches
- Created `entity_copies` table — truth entity interpretations per reality, carrying `name`, `description`, `local_attributes` (JSONB delta)
- Seeded root reality `id=1`, `name='Root'`, `parent_reality_id=NULL`
- RLS: public SELECT on both tables; service role INSERT/UPDATE for Edge Function writes
- Indexes: `reality_id`, `(truth_entity_type, truth_entity_id)`, `(reality_id, truth_entity_type)`

**Key decisions:**
- Truth schema is **inert and complete** — no names, no descriptions, no narrative; never modified by this layer
- Realities are the **world-instance axis**; branches remain the **time axis**
- Copies start with truth attribute values (`local_attributes: {}`); diverge independently per reality
- Names derived deterministically from `copy_id` + `proc_words` + reality context — stable within a reality, unique across realities
- `truth_entity_type` CHECK constraint: `character | material | setting | physical_environment | event`
- `UNIQUE(reality_id, truth_entity_type, truth_entity_id)` — one copy per truth entity per reality

---

### 🔼 Next: Milestone 13b — Setting Identity via Reality Layer
**Status:** Not started

**Goal:** Wire `discover-cell` to create `entity_copies` for newly spawned settings in the Root reality (`reality_id=1`), and derive a procedural name + description. Surface the setting's copy name in the frontend sidebar and colour-code grid cells by setting.

**Scope:**
- [ ] `discover-cell` v3: on setting spawn, INSERT into `entity_copies` (`reality_id=1`, `truth_entity_type='setting'`, `truth_entity_id=<new_id>`) with `name` derived from `proc_words` using `copy_id` as seed
- [ ] `description` field: short procedural phrase (adj + noun pattern from `proc_words`)
- [ ] Return `copy_name` and `copy_description` in `discover-cell` response payload
- [ ] `app.js`: display `copy_name` in `charSettingEl` on cell entry
- [ ] Grid renderer: colour-code cells by `setting_id` so boundaries are visually apparent
- [ ] Backfill: INSERT `entity_copies` for existing `settings` rows (id=1 and any dynamically spawned)
- [ ] Consider: `setting_type` enum (forest/ocean/desert/city/void) as future biome scaffold in `local_attributes`

## Developer Notes — Future Ideas

---

### 💡 Idea 1 — Attribute Pool on Entity Destruction

**Concept:** When an entity's `health` or `durability` reaches `0`, its `attribute_modifiers` rows move into a shared pool. Newly spawned entities draw from this pool to seed initial attributes — ecological inheritance across world history.

**Design considerations:**
- New table `attribute_pool` or `pooled BOOLEAN` flag on `attribute_modifiers`
- `world_tick()` spawn logic queries pool for new entity seeding
- Pool scoped per `setting_id` (local inheritance) or global
- Destruction trigger on `characters.health` and `materials.durability`
- Chronicle entry records destruction events for lineage tracing

---

### 💡 Idea 2 — Age-Based Attribute Modification

**Concept:** Characters' attributes automatically modified at age bracket thresholds (youth/prime/elder). Aging already tracked in `world_tick()`.

**Design considerations:**
- Age bracket thresholds as constants or `age_brackets` config table
- On tick, check if age crosses bracket; insert/update `attribute_modifiers`
- Modifier values seeded procedurally for unique aging curves
- Could interact with Idea 1: young vs. old death contributes differently weighted attribute pools
- Permanent (accumulating) vs. per-bracket (replaced) modifiers

---

### 💡 Idea 3 — Vertical z-Axis Physical Mechanics

**Concept:** `z` coordinate as axis for gravity, buoyancy, flight, elevation advantage.

**Design considerations:**
- Structures as stacked z-layers; `seed_setting_grid()` gains `z_layers` param
- Gravity: characters without support at `z-1` fall per tick unless `flight`/`buoyancy` attribute
- Air travel: `z=2+` accessible only to `flight` entities
- Water: `z=-1` and below; requires `buoyancy`/`breath`; accelerated material decay
- Height advantage: higher z → attribute modifier bonus on conflict actions
- No schema changes needed; z>0 cells seeded on structure spawn; Up/Down already wired

---

### 💡 Idea 4 — Text-Based Command Mode

**Concept:** Toggle between button UI and text command input. Same underlying `submitAction()` calls — text mode is an alternate input layer only.

**Command Dictionary (draft):**

| Command | Aliases | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `go north` | `go n`, `n` | `travel` → N |
| `go south` | `go s`, `s` | `travel` → S |
| `go east` | `go e`, `e` | `travel` → E |
| `go west` | `go w`, `w` | `travel` → W |
| `go up` | `up`, `u`, `ascend` | `travel` → Up |
| `go down` | `down`, `d`, `descend` | `travel` → Down |
| `rest` | `wait`, `idle` | `rest` |
| `talk` | `exchange info`, `speak` | `exchange_info` |
| `fight` | `attack`, `conflict` | `introduce_conflict` |
| `resolve` | `resolve conflict` | `resolve_conflict` |
| `trade` | `exchange material`, `give` | `exchange_material` |
| `look` | `l`, `examine` | (local) print cell info |
| `help` | `?`, `commands` | (local) print command list |

**Implementation path:**
1. Toggle switch in `frontend/index.html` sidebar
2. Toggle handler shows/hides button panel vs. text input
3. `parseCommand(input)` — trims, lowercases, matches alias table, calls `submitAction()` or `openTravelModal()`
4. Travel commands bypass modal entirely
5. `look` and `help` write to `statusEl` without server round-trip
6. Unknown input: `statusEl.textContent = 'unknown command — type "help" for a list'`
