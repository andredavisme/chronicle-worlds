# Chronicle Worlds — Progress Log

This document is the **single source of truth** for development progress. Each milestone includes what was done, key decisions, and exactly what to do next — with direct references to prior work so development can resume from this file alone.

---

## Project Overview

**Chronicle Worlds** is a turn-based, multiplayer, procedural world simulation hosted entirely on Supabase, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. Players control characters on a shared 3D grid, issuing one of five actions per turn simultaneously, with time as the core resource.

**Stack:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions + Auth + Realtime) · GitHub (migrations, versioning, CI/CD) · GitHub Pages (Vite + JS frontend)

**Supabase Project:** andredavisme's Project (`hhyhulqngdkwsxhymmcd`, region: `us-west-2`)

**Inspired by:** [andredavisme/the-world](https://github.com/andredavisme/the-world)

## Milestone Log

---

### ✅ Milestone 1 — Database Schema: Core Tables
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Status:** Complete
**Migration:** `001_core_schema` (applied via Supabase MCP)

**What was done:**
All 10 base tables were created in the Supabase project. These form the world simulation layer — no multiplayer or auth logic yet, just the raw game entities and their relationships.

**Tables created:**
- `settings` — world settings with 3D origin coordinates and time tracking
- `grid_cells` — individual 3D grid positions linked to settings
- `characters` — player-controlled entities with stat attributes (health, attack, defense, wealth, inspiration, size)
- `physical_environments` — environment state per setting (temperature, density, hydration, population)
- `events` — game actions logged with timestamps, type, duration, and `resolution_state` (default: `'pending'`)
- `materials` — in-world items with durability, source, and implementation
- `entity_positions` — tracks where any entity is on the grid over time
- `chronicle` — master event log; the central join table referencing all entity types, timestamped and sequenced
- `attribute_modifiers` — dynamic stat modifiers applied by events to any entity
- `relationship_effects` — relational outcomes between entities driven by events

**Key decisions:**
- All PKs are integers; `chronicle` is the central join table
- `events.resolution_state` defaults to `'pending'` and is the primary game-loop state driver
- `events.setting_id` is NOT NULL in the live DB — every event must belong to a setting; a genesis `settings` row must be seeded before any turn can be submitted
- No auth or player identity in this migration — that comes in Milestone 2

### ✅ Milestone 2 — Database Schema: Multiplayer Extensions
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Status:** Complete
**Migration:** `002_multiplayer_extensions` (applied via Supabase MCP)
**Builds on:** Milestone 1 tables (`chronicle`, `events`, `characters`)

**What was done:**
Extended the core schema with player identity, turn mechanics, time-travel branching, RLS visibility, and race-resolution infrastructure.

**Tables created:**
- `players` — UUID-identified players (`gen_random_uuid()`), each linked to a `controlled_character_id` → `characters`
- `branches` — tracks time-travel forks; each row has a `parent_branch_id` (default `0` = root); max 3 forks per lineage enforced at query level via `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM branches WHERE parent_branch_id = X`
- `player_chronicle_access` — maps which chronicle entries a player can see, with an `access_level` (default: `'view'`)

**Columns added:**
- `chronicle`: `player_id` (→ `players`), `branch_id` (default `0`), `turn_number`, `submit_timestamp`, `resolution_order`
- `events`: `turn_number`, `submit_timestamp`

**Security:**
- RLS enabled on `chronicle`
- Policy `"Player chronicle view"`: `FOR SELECT USING (player_id = auth.uid())` — players see only their own rows

**Trigger:**
- `advance_turn()` — `BEFORE INSERT` on `chronicle`; auto-increments `turn_number` per `player_id` using `MAX(turn_number)` from existing rows

**View:**
- `turn_queue` — joins `chronicle → events` on `event_id`, filters `events.resolution_state = 'pending'`, ranks by `submit_timestamp ASC` within each `turn_number` → `queue_pos`
- ⚠️ Note: `resolution_state` lives on `events`, not `chronicle` — the view join is intentional

**Key decisions:**
- `branch_id = 0` is the root/main timeline
- Branch fork limit is enforced at the application layer (Edge Function), not a DB constraint
- RLS is the sole visibility gate — no separate API-layer filtering needed

### ✅ Milestone 3 — Backend: Edge Function `resolve-turn`
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Status:** Complete
**Deployed via:** Supabase MCP (`deploy_edge_function`)
**Function ID:** `a68468fa-a326-4f75-9d51-72a73fa8e9c2`
**Current version:** v2 (bug fix: `event.eventid` → `event.event_id`)
**Builds on:** Milestones 1 & 2 (all tables, `turn_queue` view, `players`, `branches`, `chronicle`)

**What was done:**
Deployed the `resolve-turn` Supabase Edge Function at `functions/resolve-turn/index.ts`. This is the core server-side turn engine — all client actions route through it.

**Logic implemented (in order):**
1. Validate `action` and `player_id` from request body
2. Check `turn_queue` view — if `queue_pos > 1`, return `202 { status: 'queued' }`
3. Resolve the player's `controlled_character_id` from the `players` table
4. Compute `duration_units` from `DURATION_MAP` (or `computeTravelDuration()` for `travel` action)
5. Check branch fork limit — if `details.branch_fork` is set, count `branches WHERE parent_branch_id = X`; reject with `409` if ≥ 3; otherwise insert new branch row
6. Insert into `events` with `resolution_state = 'pending'`; **`setting_id` is required** — client must pass `details.setting_id`
7. Call `applyModifiers()` — inserts one `attribute_modifiers` row per action type
8. Insert into `chronicle` (links `event_id`, `character_id`, `player_id`, `branch_id`, timestamps)
9. Update `events.resolution_state = 'resolved'`
10. Broadcast `turn_resolved` to Supabase Realtime channel `'turns'`
11. Return `200 { status: 'resolved', event }`

**Modifier map (per action):**
- `exchange_information` → `inspiration +3`
- `resolve_conflict` → `health +3`
- `introduce_conflict` → `health -3`
- `exchange_material` → `wealth +3`
- `travel` → no modifier (duration only)

**Travel duration formula:**
```
base = (density + hydration) / 2
charPenalty = size / max(health, 0.1)
matBonus = durability * implementation
inspBonus = 0.9 if inspiration > 0 else 1
duration = max(1, round(base * charPenalty / matBonus * inspBonus))
```

**Key decisions:**
- Uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to bypass RLS for server-side writes; RLS still governs all client reads
- JWT verification enabled (`verify_jwt: true`) — client must pass a valid Supabase Auth token
- `event.event_id` is the correct PK field returned from the insert `.select('event_id, turn_number')` — v1 had a bug using `event.eventid` which silently broke modifier inserts and resolution updates
- Chronicle insert triggers `advance_turn()` automatically (Milestone 2 trigger)
- Branch fork insert happens before event insert so `branch_id` is available

**Fixes applied:**
- v1 → v2: `event.eventid` → `event.event_id` (all three references: modifier insert, chronicle insert, resolution update)
- Migrations 001 and 002 were applied via MCP but never committed; retroactively added to `backend/migrations/` and verified against live schema
- `events.setting_id` NOT NULL discovered during smoke test — corrected in `001_core_schema.sql` and documented here

---

### ✅ Milestone 3a — Smoke Test: Full Turn Pipeline
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Status:** Complete
**Depends on:** Milestone 3

**What was tested:**
Full end-to-end turn pipeline simulated directly in SQL (pg_net not available on this project, so HTTP invoke was not used; JWT auth gate also prevents direct curl without a real auth user).

**Test data:**
- `settings` row: `setting_id=1`, genesis at `(0,0,0)`
- `characters` row: `character_id=1`, `health=10`, all other stats at 0
- `players` row: `player_id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, `controlled_character_id=1`

**Steps verified:**
1. ✅ `turn_queue` — empty for test player (no pending turns blocking queue)
2. ✅ `events` insert — `exchange_information`, `duration_units=10`, `resolution_state='pending'`
3. ✅ `attribute_modifiers` insert — `inspiration +3` applied to `character_id=1`
4. ✅ `chronicle` insert — `turn_number=1` auto-set by `advance_turn()` trigger, `branch_id=0`
5. ✅ `events` update — `resolution_state` changed to `'resolved'`

**Schema finding recorded:**
- `events.setting_id` is NOT NULL in the live DB — design spec had it as nullable. Every event requires a setting context. The genesis `settings` row (id=1) must exist before any turn is submitted. Updated `001_core_schema.sql` to reflect this.

### ✅ Milestone 4 — Frontend: GitHub Pages Scaffold
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Status:** Complete
**Commit:** `712566b91153feba5ad843cffbb905bbd3a45368`
**Builds on:** Milestones 3 & 3a (Edge Function live, smoke test passed)

**What was done:**
Full Vite + JS frontend scaffolded in `/frontend/` and GitHub Actions deploy workflow added. All five game modules are wired together. The frontend is ready to serve from GitHub Pages once the Pages source is configured.

**Files created:**
- `frontend/index.html` — full game UI: auth panel, isometric canvas, action buttons, chronicle sidebar, footer with player/turn/branch state
- `frontend/package.json` — Vite `^5.4` + `@supabase/supabase-js ^2.49.4`
- `frontend/vite.config.js` — `base: '/chronicle-worlds/'`, `outDir: '../docs'` (GitHub Pages from `/docs` on `main`)
- `frontend/src/supabase-client.js` — Auth helpers (`signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`, `onAuthChange`); uses publishable key `sb_publishable_haKvwV0M7KMj4Qz69M6WGg_KmIfU-aI`
- `frontend/src/turn-manager.js` — `submitAction()` with race `submit_timestamp`, 1-min client cooldown, `resetCooldown()`; always passes `details.setting_id = 1`
- `frontend/src/grid-renderer.js` — isometric canvas renderer; loads `entity_positions` (active only via `timestamp_end IS NULL`); `updateGrid()` called by Realtime
- `frontend/src/chronicle-reader.js` — queries `chronicle` (RLS auto-filters to `auth.uid()`); renders entries with branch color coding (branch 1/2/3 = purple/red/teal)
- `frontend/src/app.js` — auth state machine; wires all modules; subscribes to Realtime `'turns'` channel `turn_resolved` broadcast
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — triggers on push to `main` when `frontend/**` or `docs/**` changes; builds with Vite; deploys `/docs` via `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`

**Key decisions:**
- Publishable key (not legacy anon key) used in client — better security, independent rotation
- `details.setting_id = 1` hardcoded in `turn-manager.js` as `DEFAULT_SETTING_ID` — update when world has multiple settings
- `sequence_index` is a random integer tiebreaker per submit; server race logic uses `submit_timestamp` first
- Action buttons are disabled during in-flight requests; re-enabled on resolve or error
- Chronicle renders last 40 entries descending; Realtime optimistically prepends new entries without refetch

**One manual step required:**
Go to **GitHub repo → Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch `main`, folder `/docs`**. The workflow handles all subsequent deploys automatically.

### ✅ Milestone 5 — Realtime: Turn Subscription
**Status:** Complete (implemented inside Milestone 4)
**Implemented in:** `frontend/src/app.js`

Realtime subscription to the `'turns'` channel is live. On `turn_resolved` broadcast: `updateGrid()` re-renders entity positions, `resetCooldown()` restarts the 1-min timer, `loadChronicle()` refreshes the chronicle panel, and `branch-info` footer updates to show the current branch.

---

### ✅ Milestone 6 — Chronicle Panel: Player-Filtered Display
**Status:** Complete (implemented inside Milestone 4)
**Implemented in:** `frontend/src/chronicle-reader.js`

`loadChronicle()` queries `chronicle` ordered by `timestamp DESC` + `sequence_index DESC`, limit 40. RLS automatically scopes results to `player_id = auth.uid()`. Branch color coding: branch 0 = no indicator, branch 1 = purple, branch 2 = red, branch 3 = teal.

---

### 🔲 Milestone 7 — Testing: Multiplayer & Edge Cases
**Date:** 2026-05-10
**Status:** In progress
**Migration:** `004_milestone7_tests` (committed to repo; NOT applied to live DB — run manually in SQL Editor)
**Depends on:** Real Supabase Auth user + `players` row + GitHub Pages configured

**Setup completed:**
- ✅ Auth user created via Supabase dashboard
- ✅ `players` row inserted linking `auth.uid()` to `character_id=1`
- ✅ GitHub Pages configured (source: `main`, folder: `/docs`)

**How to run the test suite:**
1. Open `backend/migrations/004_milestone7_tests.sql`
2. Replace `PLAYER_A_UUID` with your real auth user UUID
3. Optionally replace `PLAYER_B_UUID` with a second auth user UUID for RLS isolation test
4. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor and run
5. Inspect each result set — expected outcomes documented inline
6. Change `ROLLBACK` → `COMMIT` at the bottom only if you want fixtures persisted for live client testing

**Tests in `004_milestone7_tests.sql`:**
- **Test 1** — `setting_id` NOT NULL: good insert succeeds; bad insert (commented) raises error
- **Test 2** — `advance_turn` trigger: two chronicle inserts produce incrementing `turn_number`
- **Test 3** — `turn_queue` race ordering: earlier `submit_timestamp` → `queue_pos = 1`
- **Test 4** — Branch limit count: 3 forks inserted; query shows Edge Function would block 4th
- **Test 5** — Natural progression schedule: generates expected ticks for environment/material/population cycles across 500 time units
- **Test 6** — Travel duration formula: validates Edge Function math against live `physical_environments` + `materials` + `characters` rows
- **Test 7** — RLS isolation data setup: inserts player B chronicle row; client-side sign-in test required to confirm RLS blocks cross-player reads

**Remaining client-side checks (manual, requires live frontend):**
- [ ] Sign in as player A → submit one action → confirm chronicle panel updates and cooldown resets on Realtime broadcast
- [ ] Sign in as player B → confirm player A's chronicle rows do not appear
- [ ] Attempt 4th branch fork from client → confirm Edge Function returns 409
- [ ] Attempt submit without `setting_id` from client → confirm 500 response

---

### 🔲 Milestone 8 — Polish, Docs & Deploy Pipeline
**Status:** Not started
**Depends on:** Milestone 7 client-side checks passing

**What to build:**
- [ ] `README.md` — project overview, local dev setup, deploy instructions
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness for canvas grid
- [ ] Supabase Pro upgrade for production (`$25/mo`) if load tests require it
- [ ] Setting shards documented as scale path
